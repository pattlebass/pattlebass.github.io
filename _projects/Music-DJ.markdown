You might get warnings about this app not being safe. Like [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LlLiX.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/VlnKgTB.png). That's because I'm not a verified publisher and there is nothing I can do at the moment.

On Android, you'll need to allow apps from unknown sources. If you don't know how to do that, search a tutorial for your specific Android version.
